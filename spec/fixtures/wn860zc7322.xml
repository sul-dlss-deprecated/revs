  <field name="description_tsim">Dugdale began his career in 1933 as a motor sports photo-journalist with Autocar magazine. In the 1960s and 1970s he held several important positions in the automotive industry, most notably as the public relations director for the Jaguar, Rover, and Triumph Division at British Leyland of America. The John Dugdale Collection consists of monochrome and color photographs from 1935 through 1948. The collection includes rare images of attempts at the Land Speed Record from Nazi-era Germany along the Autobahns as well as John Cobb’s 1939 Napier-Railton land speed car at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Other images include the French Grand Prix and German Grand Prix in 1938 and photographs of the brilliantly talented British driver Dick Seaman who raced for Mercedes-Benz in the late 1930s. Dugdale was a personal friend of Reid Railton, one of Great Britain’s most influential automotive engineers.</field>
