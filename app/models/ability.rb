    # NOTE: only certain actions are actually checked for permissions, therefore most actions are allowed by default
    # and do not need to be defined here.  Update, create and destroy actions are checked for permissions via the resourceful.rb
    # file, which acts as the superclass for most controllers.  All other actions by default are not checked and are fully allowed.
