        <p class="faq-question">
          How do I let you know about corrections or problems with a title or other piece of information about an image?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">The best way to let us know is to %{sign_up_link} for an account and use the "flag a correction" action on any item page.  If you don't have an account and don't want to create one, you can also let us know via the %{corrections_link} form, but we may not be able to respond individually.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I would like to reuse images on my own website, in a publication, for research or for commercial purposes. Can I do this?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">All of the content is currently under a full copyright from The Revs Institute for Automotive Research, Inc. and you should review their %{reuse_link}.  You can also review Stanford's %{terms_of_use_link}.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          When I try and download a full size image, it asks me to login with a SUNET ID and says I need be part of Stanford University.  What is that and can I get one?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">High resolution images are only available to members of the Stanford community through a prior agreement.  SUNET IDs are only available to authorized Stanford users and we are not able to create one for you.  If you wish 
          to obtain a high resolution image for any reason, please review %{reuse_link}.  Note that anyone can view high resolution versions of the images in the website by selecting "zoom" in the drop-down menu under any of the images.  You can then zoom in and out to view detail, but you will not be able to download the images to your computer.

        	 The %{revs_institute} has a large and varied collection of automotive materials, including images, research books, ephemera, and specialized documents. 
           The Revs Program at Stanford is producing research data and generating course materials.  The primary goal of the Stanford Library is to ensure these materials are indexed, preserved and made
           available to library patrons, researchers and the general public.  By digitizing materials and making them discoverable, content that was once available to a select few becomes useful and
           discoverable for a wide range of researchers. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	%{revs_about_scanning_image}
        	Working with <a href="http://pixelacuity.com/">Pixel Acuity</a>, The Revs Institute for Automotive Research, Inc. is digitizing their collection of images using specialized digital cameras.  Each slide, negative or print is cleaned and imaged at a high resolution.
          The images and associated metadata are collected and transferred to Stanford, where they are being accessioned into the 
          <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/projects/stanford-digital-repository">Stanford Digital Repository</a> (SDR).
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Stanford Digital Repository ensures each digital object is preserved, made available via a permanent persistent URL (web address), enforces content rights and restrictions and provides a common 
          storage mechanism for other applications to build upon.  Research and course material from the Revs Program at Stanford will also be stored in SDR, and all materials will be discoverable via Stanford
           Library's online catalog, <a href="http://searchworks.stanford.edu">SearchWorks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Revs Digital Library is built on top of the Stanford Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for discovery of automotive research and images. The Digital Library is developed 
          in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> using open source technologies, including <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>, <a href="http://projecthydra.org/">Hydra</a>, 
          and <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora Commons</a> and will allow for metadata editing, provide community features, and tools for researchers to further utilize the data.
