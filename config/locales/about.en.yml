        <p class="faq-question">
          How do I let you know about corrections or problems with a title or other piece of information about an image?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">The best way to let us know is to %{sign_up_link} for an account and use the "flag a correction" action on any item page.  If you don't have an account and don't want to create one, you can also let us know via the %{corrections_link} form, but we may not be able to respond individually.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I would like to reuse images on my own website, in a publication, for research or for commercial purposes. Can I do this?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Most of the content is copyrighted.  Please contact us to assess permissions. You can also review Stanford's %{terms_of_use_link}.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          When I try and download a full size image, it asks me to login with a SUNET ID and says I need be part of Stanford University.  What is that and can I get one?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">High resolution images are only available to members of the Stanford community through a prior agreement.  SUNET IDs are only available to authorized Stanford users and we are not able to create one for you. Note that anyone can view high resolution versions of the images in the website by selecting "zoom" in the drop-down menu under any of the images.  You can then zoom in and out to view detail, but you will not be able to download the images to your computer.  It is not permissable to obtain high resolution images without following the re-use requirements and terms.

           The primary goal of the %{stanford_library} is to ensure that the automobility related digital assets of Stanford University are indexed, preserved and made
           available to library patrons, researchers and the general public.  By digitizing materials and making them discoverable, content that was once available to a select few becomes useful and
           discoverable for a wide range of researchers.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Stanford Digital Repository ensures preservation of each digital object, makes each digital object available via a permanent persistent URL (web address), enforces content rights and restrictions and provides a common
          storage mechanism for other applications to build upon.  Research and course material from the Revs Program at Stanford will also be stored in SDR, and all materials will be discoverable via the Stanford
          Libraries' online catalog, <a href="http://searchworks.stanford.edu">SearchWorks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Automotive Digital Library is built on top of the Stanford Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for discovery of automotive research and images. The Digital Library is developed
          in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> using open source technologies, including <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>, <a href="http://projecthydra.org/">Hydra</a>,
          and <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora Commons</a> and allows for curator restricted in-line metadata editing, provides community features, annotation, and other tools for researchers to further utilize the data.

          <h3>Road & Track Archive</h3>
          <p>The Road & Track Archive contains a digitized selection of files from Road & Track magazine's 65-year history.  The full archive includes images, notes, performance data and other types of documents and research that supported production of the magazine over its history.</p>
          <p>Among the gems from the full archives: original photography from the '50s and '60s, a sampling of the collection's 2,000 books and even old letters from manufacturers complaining to Road & Track editors about negative product reviews.</p>
          <p>The archive once filled a two-car garage at Road & Track's Newport Beach facility before the magazine moved to Michigan, and now resides in Stanford Libraries' Special Collections, where they are available on request for academic research.  As additional materials are digited, they will become available in the Revs Digital Library.</p>
