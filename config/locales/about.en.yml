        <p class="faq-question">
          How do I let you know about corrections or problems with a title or other piece of information about an image?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">The best way to let us know is to %{sign_up_link} for an account and use the "flag a correction" action on any item page.  If you don't have an account and don't want to create one, you can also let us know via the %{corrections_link} form, but we may not be able to respond individually.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I would like to reuse images on my own website, in a publication, for research or for commercial purposes. Can I do this?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">All of the content is currently under a full copyright, mostly from The Revs Institute.  The actual copyright and usage statement for each image is available on the page showing the image, to the right.  It is your responsibility to review this statement and adhere to it.  For content owned by The Revs Institute, you should review their %{reuse_link}. You can also review Stanford's %{terms_of_use_link}.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          When I try and download a full size image, it asks me to login with a SUNET ID and says I need be part of Stanford University.  What is that and can I get one?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">High resolution images are only available to members of the Stanford community through a prior agreement.  SUNET IDs are only available to authorized Stanford users and we are not able to create one for you.  If you wish
          to obtain a high resolution image for any reason, please review %{reuse_link}.  Note that anyone can view high resolution versions of the images in the website by selecting "zoom" in the drop-down menu under any of the images.  You can then zoom in and out to view detail, but you will not be able to download the images to your computer.  It is not permissable to obtain high resolution images without following the re-use requirements and terms.

        	  %{revs_institute_for_auto_research} has an extensive Special Collections library and archive of automotive history materials within its purpose built facility in Naples, Florida. The Revs Institute&reg; library consists of over one million images, research books, ephemera, and specialized documents including items
            from the Collier Collection&trade;.
        </p>
        <p>
           The %{revs_program} is producing research data and generating course materials.  The primary goal of the %{stanford_library} is to ensure these materials are indexed, preserved and made
           available to library patrons, researchers and the general public.  By digitizing materials and making them discoverable, content that was once available to a select few becomes useful and
           discoverable for a wide range of researchers.
        </p>
        <p>
        	%{revs_about_scanning_image}
        	Working with <a href="http://pixelacuity.com/">Pixel Acuity</a>, The Revs Institute&reg; is digitizing its collection of images using specialized digital cameras to build a collection for a Digital Library.
          Each slide, negative or print is cleaned and imaged at a high resolution.  The images and associated metadata are collected and licensed to Stanford University, where they are being accessioned into the
          <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-digital-repository">Stanford Digital Repository</a> (SDR).
          Permission for use requirements and sales of Rights Managed images are available directly through the %{photo_sales}&reg;.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Stanford Digital Repository ensures preservation of each digital object, makes each digital object available via a permanent persistent URL (web address), enforces content rights and restrictions and provides a common
          storage mechanism for other applications to build upon.  Research and course material from the Revs Program at Stanford will also be stored in SDR, and all materials will be discoverable via the Stanford
          Libraries' online catalog, <a href="http://searchworks.stanford.edu">SearchWorks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Revs Digital Library is built on top of the Stanford Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for discovery of automotive research and images. The Digital Library is developed
          in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> using open source technologies, including <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>, <a href="http://projecthydra.org/">Hydra</a>,
          and <a href="http://fedora-commons.org/">Fedora Commons</a> and allows for curator restricted in-line metadata editing, provides community features, annotation, and other tools for researchers to further utilize the data.

          <h3>Revs Institute&reg; Archives</h3>
          <p>The Revs Institute is a 501 (c) (3) organization located in Naples, Florida.  It is a repository for one of the world’s largest research collections dedicated to the understanding of automotive history.  In addition to books, periodicals, documents, art, and ephemera, the collection includes approximately one million images, many of which can be accessed via the Revs Digital Library. The images within this photograph collection span a period from the late 19th Century to the present day.  They document international motor sports, production and custom-body cars, automotive design and engineering, auto shows, and industry personalities and race car drivers.</p>
          <p>The Revs Digital Library provides excellent geographic coverage of both Europe and America with a focus on major international Grand Prix and sports car racing, plus coverage of a broad range of road course and oval events in the United States.  In addition to the study of automotive history, the research facility provides resources to understand the broader historic context of both the 19th and 20th centuries—themes such as the impact of the automobile on art, literature, engineering, architecture and social history.  The Revs Digital Library, which was launched in 2014, is a dynamic resource which continues to grow each year as new images are added to the collection.</p>

          <h3>Road & Track Archive</h3>
          <p>The Road & Track Archive contains a digitized selection of files from Road & Track magazine's 65-year history.  The full archive includes images, notes, performance data and other types of documents and research that supported production of the magazine over its history.</p>
          <p>Among the gems from the full archives: original photography from the '50s and '60s, a sampling of the collection's 2,000 books and even old letters from manufacturers complaining to Road & Track editors about negative product reviews.</p>
          <p>The archive once filled a two-car garage at Road & Track's Newport Beach facility before the magazine moved to Michigan, and now resides in Stanford Libraries' Special Collections, where they are available on request for academic research.  As additional materials are digited, they will become available in the Revs Digital Library.</p>
